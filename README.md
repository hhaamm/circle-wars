Circle Wars is a simple Javascript game which illustrate a fight between two... circles!

Obviously, circles are very agressive, and they have a lot of weapons to use.

The game allows two players, using one keyboard, to fight in a random scenary with different weapons and materials.

New improvements are coming when I have some spare time.
